# Reflection: AI-Enhanced Landing Page

**Which AI tool(s) did you use?**  
I used ChatGPT to generate sections of my HTML and CSS.

**How did it help you?**  
AI helped me speed up the coding process, especially for structuring the navigation bar, creating the form, and applying responsive design with my brand colors.

**What challenges did you encounter?**  
One challenge was making the site mobile-responsive and ensuring the dark purple and lime green color palette looked professional. I also had to tweak the form styling manually.

**What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?**  
I learned that AI tools are great for quickly creating a foundation and suggesting animations and layouts. However, I still had to understand and adjust the code to fit my exact needs, which gave me confidence in combining AI assistance with my own coding skills.
